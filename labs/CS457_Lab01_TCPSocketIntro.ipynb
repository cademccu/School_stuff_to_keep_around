    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This first CS457 lab is a \"gentle\" introduction to network socket programming.  For the time being we will avoid handling errors and other situations such as dealing with network byte order or asynchronous multi-connection threads.  We'll get to those issues in the next lab.\n",
    "Right now we just want study some simple examples to give you basic information on how sockets work. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab 1 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will simply execute  python code to study examples of simple socket programs; no new code needs to be written by you. Executing a cell in jupyter requires you to be in the cell and pushing SHIFT RETURN. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn how to use TCP sockets to\n",

    "1. Connect to a well known web site, google.com, and read the contents of a web page.  \n",

    "Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. In streaming mode (TCP), one socket(node) listens on a particular port, while another socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.  Data can then be exchanged in a client/server relationship.\n",

As illustrated below, Port 80, for example, is used for web servers.  Port 53 is used for DNS.  Here is a list of [well known ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers). The ports numbered from 1024 and above are called *\"ephemeral ports\"* and can be used by any application.\n",

The first parameter is `AF_INET` and the second one is `SOCK_STREAM`.  `AF_INET` refers to the IPv4 address family (later we will use IPv6). The `SOCK_STREAM` parameter means to use a socket with *connection-oriented* TCP protocol. In a future lab we will use the SOCK_DATAGRAM parameter to do UDP messaging.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when we printed the socket object, it indicated an `fd` (*file descriptor*).  Each socket is assigned a unique `fd`. There are many similarities between an `fd` for real files and an `fd` for sockets.  Both have common operations such as `open, read, write`, and `close`.  Of course, there are also fundamental differences between files and sockets -- for example, files don't have `listen` and sockets don't have `seek`.  We'll get to the socket API calls in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any event, we can now connect to a server using this socket.  But note that if any error occurs during the creation of a socket then a socket.error is thrown.

The `ping` command sends packets of data to a specific IP address on a network, and then lets you know how long it took to transmit that data and get a response. It’s a handy tool that you can use to quickly test various points of your network.  In the example below we send 3 pings to www.google.com  (the \"!\" symbol causes jupyter to execute a unix shell command).  Execute the ping command and examine the output."

    "\n",
    "- Finally we implement a block of code to receive the first block of data from the server, followed by a loop to receive the rest of the data from the server.  Why a loop?  Because the data being returned may be bigger than fits into one packet.  TCP is a STREAMING connection; we may get a lot of data back in multiple packets.  These packets are buffered inside the operating systems network stack.   We use the socket **`recv`** API to read the data and to tell the socket to give the python application no more than 10,000 bytes at each invocation.  We check the length of the data returned.  Once it hits 0, we are done. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Socket API Overview\n",
    "Python’s socket module provides an interface to the Berkeley sockets API. This is the module that we’ll use and discuss in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary socket API functions and methods in this module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "* socket()\n",
    "* bind()\n",
    "* listen()\n",
    "* accept()\n",
    "* connect()\n",
    "* connect_ex()\n",
    "* send()\n",
    "* sendall()\n",
    "* recv()\n",
    "* gethostbyname()\n",
    "* close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a convenient and consistent API that maps directly to these system calls, their C counterparts. We’ll look at how these are used together in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of its standard library, Python also has classes that make using these low-level socket functions easier. Although it’s not covered in this tutorial, see the socketserver module, a framework for network servers. There are also many modules available that implement higher-level Internet protocols like HTTP and SMTP. For an overview, see Internet Protocols and Support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the diagram below, let’s look at the sequence of socket API calls and data flow for TCP:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP Sockets\n",
    "\n",
    "As you’ll see shortly, we’ll create a socket object using socket.socket() and specify the socket type as socket.SOCK_STREAM. When you do that, the default protocol that’s used is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This is a good default and probably what you want.\n",

    "<img src=\"http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs457/images/jupyter/socketToSocket.jpg\" width=\"500px\" alt=\"socket to socket\" />\n",

    "Why should you use TCP? The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is reliable: packets dropped in the network are detected and retransmitted by the sender.\n",
    "* Has in-order data delivery: data is read by your application in the order it was written by the sender.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) sockets created with socket.SOCK_DGRAM aren’t reliable, and data read by the receiver can be out-of-order from the sender’s writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important? Networks are a best-effort delivery system. There’s no guarantee that your data will reach its destination or that you’ll receive what’s been sent to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network devices (for example, routers and switches), have finite bandwidth available and their own inherent system limitations. They have CPUs, memory, buses, and interface packet buffers, just like our clients and servers. TCP relieves you from having to worry about packet loss, data arriving out-of-order, and many other things that invariably happen when you’re communicating across a network.\n",

    "* accept()\n",

    "\n",
    "The client calls connect() to establish a connection to the server and initiate the three-way handshake. The handshake step is important since it ensures that each side of the connection is reachable in the network, in other words that the client can reach the server and vice-versa. It may be that only one host, client or server, can reach the other.\n",

    "\n",
    "* 'bind()' is used to associate the socket with a specific network interface and port number.  The values passed to bind() depend on the address family of the socket. In this example, we’re using socket.AF_INET (IPv4). So it expects a 2-tuple: (host, port).  host can be a hostname, IP address, or empty string. If an IP address is used, host should be an IPv4-formatted address string. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is the standard IPv4 address for the loopback interface, so only processes on the host will be able to connect to the server. If you pass an empty string, the server will accept connections on all available IPv4 interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'listen()' enables a server to accept() connections. It makes it a “listening” socket.  `listen()` has a backlog parameter. It specifies the number of unaccepted connections that the system will allow before refusing new connections. Starting in Python 3.5, it’s optional. If not specified, a default backlog value is chosen.  If your server receives a lot of connection requests simultaneously, increasing the backlog value may help by setting the maximum length of the queue for pending connections. The maximum value is system dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `accept()` blocks and waits for an incoming connection. When a client connects, it returns a new socket object representing the connection and a tuple holding the address of the client. The tuple will contain (host, port) for IPv4 connections or (host, port, flowinfo, scopeid) for IPv6.   **One thing that’s imperative to understand is that we now have a new socket object from accept().** This is important since the `conn` socket is the socket that you’ll use to communicate with the client. It is distinct from the *listening socket* that the server is using to accept new connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After getting the client socket object conn from `accept()`, an infinite `while` loop is used to loop over blocking calls to `conn.recv()`.
