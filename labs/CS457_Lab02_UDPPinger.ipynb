    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You had a brief and simplified introduction to **TCP** in lab 1.  There is still *much* to learn about TCP, and we will do that in future labs.  But for now let's get a good understanding of the **UDP** protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn the basics of socket programming for **UDP** in Python. You will learn how to send and receive datagram packets using UDP sockets and also, how to set a proper socket timeout. Throughout the lab, you will gain familiarity with a Ping application and its usefulness in computing statistics such as packet loss rate.\n",
    "You will first study a simple Internet ping server written in the Python, and implement a corresponding client. The functionality provided by these programs is similar to the functionality provided by standard ping programs available in modern operating systems. However, these programs use a simpler protocol, UDP, rather than the standard Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to communicate with each other. The ping protocol allows a client machine to send a packet of data to a remote machine, and have the remote machine return the data back to the client unchanged (an action referred to as echoing). Among other uses, the ping protocol allows hosts to determine round-trip times to other machines.\n",

    "### UDP socket programming: brief tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "UDP is a much simpler protocol than TCP.  It is a \"message-based\" protocol, not a streaming protocol.  In UDP, there is no need to establish a connection with a three-way handshake.  There is no state maintained.  There is no need to listen or accept a connection.  UDP is basically a simple way to send or receive a complete message (datagram). The most common example of a UDP-based application is DNS.  Streaming video and audio also use the UDP protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this simplicity by comparing the UDP flow diagram below to the one for TCP presented in lab 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs457/images/jupyter/UDPsockets.jpg\" alt=\"UDP flow diagram\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the two new socket calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sendto()` instead of `send()` \n",
    "* `recvfrom()` instead of `recv()`\n",
    "\n",
    "These two functions take two parameters, the message and an address.  The address parameter is needed because, as stated earlier, there is no state kept in the socket object.  The address parameter is actually a tuple, `(IPv4Addr, port).`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike TCP, UDP provides applications with an *unreliable transport service* due to the \"best effort\" nature of sending datagrams. Messages may get lost in the network due to heavy congestion that create router queue overflows, faulty hardware or other reasons.  Typically this is not an issue, and most request messages are sent and received ok.  But if a UDP request or response (which are based on the UDP protocol) does gets lost the user or application can simply re-issue the DNS request.  Applications that use DNS have to accomodate this behavior. "

    "### Client Code\n",
    "You need to implement the client program yourself.  A skeleton program is given below as an aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client should send 10 pings to the server. Because UDP is an unreliable protocol, a packet sent from the client to the server may be lost in the network, or vice versa. For this reason, the client cannot wait indefinitely for a reply to a ping message. You should get the client wait up to one second for a reply; if no reply is received within one second, your client program should assume that the packet was lost during transmission across the network. You will need to look up the [python socket documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) to find out how to set the timeout value on a datagram socket.  There is a lot of other useful information here as well, but most of it is irrelevant to this particular lab exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, your client program should\n",
    "\n",
    "1. send the ping message using UDP (Note: Unlike TCP, you do not need to establish a connection first, since UDP is a connectionless protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. print the response message from server, if any\n",
    "\n",
    "3. calculate and print the round trip time (RTT), in seconds, of each packet, if server responses\n",
    "\n",
    "4. otherwise, print “Request timed out”\n",
    "\n",
    "During development, you should run the UDPPingerServer.py from a terminal window, as mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your client by sending packets to localhost (or, 127.0.0.1). After you have fully debugged your code, you should see how your application communicates across the network with the ping server and ping client running on different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Message Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The ping messages in this lab are formatted in a simple way. The client message is one line, consisting of ASCII characters in the following format:\n",
    ">`Ping sequence_number time`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `sequence_number` starts at 1 and progresses to 10 for each successive ping message sent by the client, and `time` is the time when the client sends the message.  The server will convert the message to upper-case and return it to you in its echo response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program should take less than 20 lines of python code.  But don't make that a goal.  A working client should be your goal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The  lines with `YOU FILL IN` is where you write code.  This may seem like I'm spoon-feeding you, but that's OK since this is your first UDP program.  Later on I won't be as nice. You can count on that!\n",
